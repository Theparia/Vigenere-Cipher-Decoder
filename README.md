# Vigenere-Cipher-Decoder

This project aims to decipher **Vigenere cipher** texts using **genetic algorithms**. which can be divided into the following parts:

1. **Initialization and Data Preparation:** Initialize the `Decoder` class and clean the data.

2. **Genetic Algorithm Components:** Generate the initial population, calculate fitness scores, perform selection, crossover, and mutation.

3. **Decoding Process:** Decode the cipher text using the selected key chromosome.

4. **Evaluation and Results:** Evaluate the fitness of the decoded text, measure execution time, and display the results.

Through these objectives and steps, the project aims to successfully decipher Vigenere cipher texts using genetic algorithms, showcasing the application of computational techniques in cryptography.
